                <h1>About Tokyo</h1>
                <p>
                    Tokyo, played by Úrsula Corberó, is one of the main characters in the television series Money Heist.
                    She is a skilled thief and one of the eight robbers who carry out the heist on the Royal Mint of
                    Spain. She is also the narrator of the show and provides much of the voiceover commentary throughout
                    the series.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tokyo is portrayed as a strong-willed and impulsive character who is willing to take risks to
                    achieve her goals. She is a skilled fighter and is not afraid to use violence when necessary.
                    However, her impulsiveness often leads her into trouble, and she is often at odds with the more
                    cautious members of the gang.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to her role as a thief, Tokyo's relationship with Rio, another member of the gang, is a
                    key subplot throughout the show. The two characters have a tumultuous relationship, with moments of
                    intense passion and conflict. Tokyo's relationship with the other members of the gang is also
                    explored throughout the show, with the character forming close bonds with some members and
                    struggling to connect with others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the show, Tokyo's role in the heist evolves as she becomes more involved in the planning
                    and execution of the robbery. Her ability to think on her feet and her fearlessness in dangerous
                    situations prove to be valuable assets to the gang.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, Tokyo is a complex and multi-dimensional character, whose relationships with other
                    characters and her personal journey throughout the show are a key part of the series' drama and
                    tension.
