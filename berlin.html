                <h1>About Berlin</h1>
                <p>
                    Berlin, played by Pedro Alonso, is one of the main characters in the television series Money Heist.
                    He is one of the eight robbers who carry out the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain and serves as the
                    de facto leader of the robbers inside the Mint. He is also the brother of the mastermind behind the
                    heist, The Professor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Berlin is portrayed as a charismatic and suave figure, with a commanding presence that makes him a
                    natural leader. He is highly intelligent and resourceful, with a deep understanding of human nature
                    that he uses to manipulate both his fellow robbers and the hostages inside the Mint. However, he
                    also has a darker side, with a tendency to be cruel and violent when he feels threatened.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the show, Berlin's relationships with the other characters are a key focus. He is shown
                    to have a complicated relationship with The Professor, with the two brothers often clashing over
                    their different leadership styles. He is also shown to be attracted to one of the hostages inside
                    the Mint, causing conflict with some of the other robbers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the heist progresses, Berlin's leadership style becomes increasingly authoritarian, causing
                    tension among the other members of the gang. His decisions and actions ultimately have significant
                    consequences for the outcome of the heist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, Berlin is a complex and multi-dimensional character whose charisma, intelligence, and
                    darker tendencies make him both compelling and unpredictable. His relationships with other
                    characters and his role in the heist add depth and drama to the show, and his story arc is a key
                    part of the overall narrative of the series.
